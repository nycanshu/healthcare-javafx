🔹 Specific areas to test

Based on the requirements, here’s a concrete list:

1. Staff scheduling compliance

Nurses must only have one shift per day (max 8 hours).

Nurses must be assigned only within the two shifts (8–4, 2–10).

There must always be a doctor assigned every day.

✅ Positive Test: Assign a nurse correctly → no exception.

❌ Negative Test: Assign a nurse to 2 shifts in a single day → expect ComplianceException.

❌ Negative Test: No doctor assigned for a day → expect ComplianceException.

2. Bed allocation rules

A resident can only be assigned to a vacant bed.

✅ Positive Test: Assign a resident to an empty bed → succeeds.

❌ Negative Test: Try to assign a resident to an already occupied bed → expect BedOccupiedException.

❌ Negative Test: Assign a resident to a bed that doesn’t exist → expect InvalidBedException.

3. Staff permissions

Only managers can add staff.

Only doctors can prescribe.

Only nurses can administer medicine.

✅ Positive Test: Manager adds nurse → succeeds.

❌ Negative Test: Nurse tries to add another nurse → expect UnauthorizedActionException.

❌ Negative Test: Nurse tries to prescribe medicine → expect UnauthorizedActionException.

4. Medication administration

Medicine must be administered at correct times.

✅ Positive Test: Nurse administers scheduled medicine at correct time → logged successfully.

❌ Negative Test: Nurse administers medicine at wrong time → expect InvalidTimeException.

5. Serialization (saving & loading state)

All objects (residents, staff, prescriptions, logs) must be saved & restored.

✅ Positive Test: Save → restart program → load → same data restored.

6. Audit logging

Every action (admit, discharge, prescribe, administer, transfer) must be logged with staff ID and timestamp.

✅ Positive Test: Log entry is created for each action.

❌ Negative Test: If unauthorized staff performs action → action fails and is still logged as failed attempt.
